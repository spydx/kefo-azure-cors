# Introduction to CORS

The presentation is created using [Marp](https://marp.app).
Add the plugin to VSCode and you can view it directly in your editor.

To get the theme, under settings add this URL to load the CSS for the theme.
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenneth-fossen/marp-bouvet-theme/main/theme.css`

If you do not wanna do that, there is also just the PDF version of the slides available in this repository.

They both reside inside the [Presentation](/presentation/) folder in this repo.
